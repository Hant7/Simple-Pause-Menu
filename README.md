# Simple Pause Menu

This Game Maker Studio plugin is designed to allow people to easily implement a pause menu in their projects, which they can modify to their liking to adapt it to their needs quickly and easily.

## Installation

As the name suggests, installation couldn't be simpler. In the project folder, you'll find a file called ```SimplePauseMenu_local_package-2.0.3.yymps```, which you should import into your project from the tools menu. Then, select all the files and place the "pause" object in the rooms where you want the game to be able to pause, and you're all set. (This isn't the latest version available; to access the latest version, you must open the project and create your own local package).

## How to use

To access this menu within the game, it's as simple as pressing ESC on your keyboard (this key can be changed in the first variables of the step event).
